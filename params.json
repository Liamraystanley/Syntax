{"name":"Syntax","tagline":"A modular PHP IRC bot.","body":"Abigail - The Modular PHP IRC Bot\r\n=================================\r\n\r\nWhat is Abigail?\r\n================\r\n________________\r\nThis is a modular PHP IRC bot forked from [nessa](http://github.com/gluxon/nessa) developed by the BroDevs.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n________\r\n- PHP based, Which is highly configureable.\r\n- Modular - Interchangeable, and easy to addon.\r\n- Multi-OS - Can be run on many operating systems, including linux, mac, and windows.\r\n\r\nCurrent bugs\r\n------------\r\n- (FIXED!) doesn't want to auto join channels (you have to PM it to join it.)\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\n_____________\r\nThe documentation for Abigail is a work in progress. If you'd like to contribute feel free to fork Abigail and request a source merge.\r\nIf you'd like to discuss forks from this project or know what a module does, feel free to tap into our IRC channel #xBlaze on irc.esper.net:6667.\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n========\r\n________\r\nTo install Abigail, you may require a few packages.\r\n[Abigail](https://github.com/xBlazeTECH/abigail/archive/master.zip) (obviously, it's the core)\r\n[PHP5](http://us.php.net/downloads.php) (highly recommended, PHP 4+ required).\r\nnohup (for ability to fork into background, whould be in your linux distro package by default).\r\nscreen (for ability to fork into background, and reattach at a later time).\r\n- usually have to install, via \"apt-get install screen\", \"yum install screen\", or the default distrobution package manager.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n____________\r\n\r\nLinux\r\n-----\r\n_____\r\n\r\nto install Abigail on linux, make sure to have a way to fork Abigail into the background (READ ABOVE).\r\ndownload the abigail using the link above (if using a GUI linux). if you are using UNIX, or a unix based server, use `wget` to download the package.\r\n\r\n    mkdir abigail\r\n\tcd abigail\r\n\twget https://github.com/xBlazeTECH/abigail/archive/master.zip\r\n\r\nnow, unzip the archive to the `abigail` directory\r\n\r\n    unzip master.zip\r\n\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n-------\r\n_______\r\n\r\nto install Abigail on Windows, make sure you have abigail downloaded and you have PHP added to the environment path. use [this](http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.installation.php#faq.installation.addtopath) method.\r\ndownload the abigail using the link in the downloads section.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n=============\r\n_____________\r\n\r\nLinux\r\n-----\r\n_____\r\n\r\nto configure Abigail for the first time on a linux OS, you must first edit the bot.inc file. make sure you are in the `abigail` directory.\r\n\r\n    cd abigail (or what ever directory you unzipped abigail to)\r\n\r\nnow, you must copy the `bot_example.inc` file and rename the copied version to `bot.inc`. you must have a text editor installed on your linux/unix box, or direct FTP access to the file. common text editors would include `vi` or `vim`, `nano`, `emacs`, or your favorite text/source editor.\r\n\r\n    cd settings (make sure you are in the abigail directory before you do this)\r\n\tcp bot_example.inc bot.inc\r\n\tedit bot.inc (or vi bot.inc, nano bot.inc, etc)\r\n\r\nmake sure you check and recheck every setting, once you are done configuring, feel free to head to the Running Abigail section.\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n-------\r\n_______\r\n\r\nto configure Abigail on windows for the first time, just go into the `/abigail/settings/` directory and find `bot_example.inc`.\r\ncopy that file and rename the copied version of the file to `bot.inc`, and edit  the file.\r\n- Be advised, the windows notepad tends to fuck up some text-based files, so i'd recommend using notepad++. once you are done, save it, and head down to the Running Abigail, in hte windows section.\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning Abigail\r\n===============\r\n_______________\r\n\r\nLinux\r\n-----\r\n_____\r\nto run Abigail, on linux, there are a few different methods.\r\n\r\nScreen - multiscreen terminal tool\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\n    screen (hit enter twice once you type this command)\r\n\tphp abigail.php\r\n\r\nnow, to close safely just press `CTRL+A` then `CTRL+D`. then you can exit terminal, or SSH safely :D.\r\n- To get back to that screen, in terminal type `screen -r`.\r\n\r\nNohup - background process forker\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\n    nohup php abigail.php &\r\n\r\nit should push all stdout and all error messages to nohup.out. to forcefully stop a nohup process, you can kill the process with `killall -9 php`. WARNING this will kill any other process running with php.\r\n\r\nExecuteable bash script\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nAbigail has another useful tool. the executeable bash script.\r\nto use this just go to the `abigail` directory, and make it executeable, do this command:\r\n\r\n    cd abigail (or directory that you stored abigail)\r\n\tchmod +x abigail\r\n\t./abigail\r\n\r\nthis should bring up a prompt asking you to use screen, nohup, or just run without forking into background.\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n-------\r\n_______\r\n\r\nif you added PHP to your `$PATH` environment variable, then you can just double click and run abigail.bat, which is a windows DOS version command-prompt.\r\n\r\nif you did not, or do not know how to add it to your `$PATH` variable, then you have to navigate to the default PHP install directory in command-prompt and run Abigail from there. i.e:\r\n\r\n    C:/path/to/php abigail.php\r\n\r\nAbigail Copyright (C) 2013 Liam Stanley (More info here: http://liamstanley.net/gpl)\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
